A couple of react samples I put together for a presentation.

You can cd into each directory and run `npm run start` to start the apps up and see them live.


[helloworld](./helloworld) - is a simple example of a component that just says hello world
[helloworld-counter](./helloworld-counter) - is a more complex example of a react component with a button which increments an integer in the dom
[helloworld-redux-counter](./helloworld-redux-counter) - is the previous example, but the button fires an event which updates the state in redux
